[iron_ore]
text1=Iron ore refining is a multi-step process that involves several stages to produce high-purity iron.

label1=Step 1: Concentration
text2=Iron ore is crushed and ground to release the ore minerals from the gangue (impurities). The ore is then separated from the gangue using density differences, resulting in a concentrate with a higher iron content.

label2=Step 2: Sintering Fines (small particles)
text3=Small particles of iron ore are agglomerated into lumps of suitable size using a process called sintering. This involves heating the fines until partial melting occurs, allowing individual ore particles to fuse together.

label3=Step 3: Blast Furnace 
text4=The concentrated iron ore is then charged into a blast furnace, where it is heated to high temperatures (around 1773 K) with coke (carbon-rich fuel) and limestone. The coke reduces the iron oxides, producing pig iron (containing around 4% carbon and small amounts of impurities).

label4=Step 4: Refining
text5=The pig iron is further refined to produce high-purity iron. This can be done through various methods, including:
text6=Direct Reduction: Iron ore is reduced with hydrogen to produce direct reduced iron (DRI), which is then melted and refined to produce high-purity iron.
text7=Electrolysis: Iron ore is dissolved in an electrolyte solution and then electrolyzed to produce high-purity iron.
text8=Displacement: Iron ore is reacted with a more reactive metal (such as aluminum) to displace the iron, producing high-purity iron.

label5=Step 5: Casting 
text9=The refined iron is then cast into blocks called pigs, which are further processed in iron foundries to produce various forms of iron, including wrought iron and steel.
text10=Note: The specific refining process used may vary depending on the type of iron ore and the desired level of purity.

label2=Substations:
text5=Substations play a key role in effectively transmitting electricity through the national transmission system.
text6=They convert electricity into different voltages, allowing it to be transmitted throughout the country and then distributed to local neighborhoods and into homes, businesses, and buildings.
text7=Substations contain specialized equipment, such as transformers, which step up or down the voltage of electricity.

label3=Distribution Systems:
text9=A distribution system originates at a distribution substation and includes the lines, poles, transformers, and other equipment needed to deliver electric power to customers at the required voltages.
text10=Customers are classified as residential, commercial, or industrial, each requiring different voltage levels and distribution systems.
text11=Residential customers receive power through a service drop line, which leads from the distribution pole transformer to their structure, either overhead or underground.
text12=Commercial customers are usually served at distribution voltages, ranging from 14.4 kV to 7.2 kV, through a service drop line.
text13=Industrial customers often require 2,400 to 4,160 volts and may have their own substation or substations to reduce the voltage from the transmission line to the desired level for distribution throughout the plant area.

label4=Summary:
text14=In summary, power poles and substations are critical components of the power distribution system, working together to transmit electricity from power plants to consumers. Power poles support overhead power lines, while substations convert and distribute electricity to meet the needs of different customer types.
