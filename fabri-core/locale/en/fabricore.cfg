[iron_ore]
text1=Iron ore refining is a multi-step process that involves several stages to produce high-purity iron.

label1=Step 1: Concentration
text2=Iron ore is crushed and ground to release the ore minerals from the gangue (impurities). The ore is then separated from the gangue using density differences, resulting in a concentrate with a higher iron content.

label2=Step 2: Sintering Fines (small particles)
text3=Small particles of iron ore are agglomerated into lumps of suitable size using a process called sintering. This involves heating the fines until partial melting occurs, allowing individual ore particles to fuse together.

label3=Step 3: Blast Furnace 
text4=The concentrated iron ore is then charged into a blast furnace, where it is heated to high temperatures (around 1773 K) with coke (carbon-rich fuel) and limestone. The coke reduces the iron oxides, producing pig iron (containing around 4% carbon and small amounts of impurities).

label4=Step 4: Refining
text5=The pig iron is further refined to produce high-purity iron. This can be done through various methods, including:
text6=Direct Reduction: Iron ore is reduced with hydrogen to produce direct reduced iron (DRI), which is then melted and refined to produce high-purity iron.
text7=Electrolysis: Iron ore is dissolved in an electrolyte solution and then electrolyzed to produce high-purity iron.
text8=Displacement: Iron ore is reacted with a more reactive metal (such as aluminum) to displace the iron, producing high-purity iron.

label5=Step 5: Casting 
text9=The refined iron is then cast into blocks called pigs, which are further processed in iron foundries to produce various forms of iron, including wrought iron and steel.
text10=Note: The specific refining process used may vary depending on the type of iron ore and the desired level of purity.

[copper_ore]
text1=The copper ore refining process involves several stages to extract copper from its ores and produce high-purity copper.

label1=Mining and Crushing: 
text2=Copper ore is mined and crushed to separate the copper from waste rock.

label2=Roasting: 
text3=The crushed ore is roasted to convert sulfides to oxides, making it easier to extract copper.

label3=Smelting:

text5=The matte is further refined through electrolysis, where copper is extracted from the anode and deposited on the cathode.

label5=Electrolysis: 
text6=The anode slabs are hung in a tank filled with an electrolyte solution, and an electric current is applied. Copper ions move through the solution and are deposited on the cathode, producing 99.99% pure copper.

label6=Final Processing: 
text7=The refined copper is then rolled, drawn, or extruded into various shapes and forms for use in various applications.
text8=Pyrometallurgy and Hydrometallurgy: The refining process depends on the type of minerals the copper is bound with. Copper ore rich in sulfides is processed via pyrometallurgy, while copper ore rich in oxides is refined through hydrometallurgy.
text9=Copper ore refining involves several stages, including mining, crushing, roasting, smelting, refining, and electrolysis.

The logistics behind power distribution involve the transportation of electricity from power plants to consumers through a network of power poles and substations.

label1=Power Poles:
text2=Power poles, also known as utility poles, are used to support overhead power lines that transmit electricity from substations to consumers.
text3=They typically carry primary or main wires that connect to nearby substations and can carry between 7,200 to 34,500 volts, with 12,000 volts being most common.
text4=Power poles also contain the neutral wire, which is a return line that goes back to the substation and helps to balance the amount of electricity out on the system.

label2=Substations:
text5=Substations play a key role in effectively transmitting electricity through the national transmission system.
text6=They convert electricity into different voltages, allowing it to be transmitted throughout the country and then distributed to local neighborhoods and into homes, businesses, and buildings.
text7=Substations contain specialized equipment, such as transformers, which step up or down the voltage of electricity.
