Factorio has a lot of parallels with real life manufacturing processes. This mod aims to give the user the ability to read more about these processes. 

# Installing
The fabri-core folder gets dropped into the factorio installation mods folder. 
On my local system it is `C:\Users\John\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods`
